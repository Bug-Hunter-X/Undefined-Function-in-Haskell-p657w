# Haskell Undefined Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a common Haskell bug: using an undefined function.  The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides the corrected version.  The error often arises from typos or forgetting to import necessary modules.  The error message generated by the compiler can be cryptic initially, but it eventually points towards the problem. 

This simple example helps illustrate a typical pitfall for those learning Haskell.
