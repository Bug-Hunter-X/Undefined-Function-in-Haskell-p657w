This Haskell code attempts to use a function that's not defined, leading to a compile-time error.  The error message may be cryptic, but carefully examining it reveals the undefined function. This is often seen with typos or forgetting to import necessary modules.

```haskell
undefinedFunction x = x + 1

main = do
  let result = myUndefinedFunction 5  --Typo here, should be undefinedFunction
  print result
```
